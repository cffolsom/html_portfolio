    <ul>
        <li>He is bad at making websites.</li>
        <li>He is a deaf guy.</li>
        <li>You'd want your website built by a deaf guy, wouldn't you?</li>
        <li>I mean, look at this guy!</li>

    <h1><strong>Jokes aside, here's info about me</strong></h1>
    <div class="info">
        <p>I am a deaf guy from Washington state that started the Coding Temple boot camp in 2022
            and is looking to complete the course to expand on my programming knowledge. This 
            portfolio is <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> a work in progress. This website is very, very
            ugly and will be improved on throughout the course hopefully. So for now, this is what
            my creative mind came up with and it will look much, much better eventually.
        </p>

            I attended the Rochester Institute of Technology from 2010 to 2016 and within my classes
            at RIT, I have taken two HTML classes, both with different emphasis on HTML subjects.
            I eventually graduated in 2016 and took my first job as a PC Operator 1 which was just
            essentially a term for "guy that moves computers from one location to other.". Afterwards,
            I got a job as a Direct Support Professional which is a caregiver, in my case, it was
            for deaf people with mental disabilities. As of this time, I am taking the boot camp
            in hopes to expand upon my education and actually do something with my life.
